                <p class="prviParagraf"> The 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture
                    Arts and Sciences
                    (AMPAS), honored films released from January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, at Union Station in Los
                    Angeles. The ceremony was held on April 25, 2021, rather than its usual late-February date due to
                    the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    During the ceremony, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to
                    as Oscars) in 23 categories.</p>
                <p class="drugiParagraf"> The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by
                    Jesse Collins, Stacey Sher, and Steven Soderbergh, and was directed by Glenn Weiss. For the third
                    consecutive year, the ceremony had no official host. In related events, the Academy Scientific and
                    Technical Awards were presented by host Nia DaCosta on February 13, 2021, in a virtual ceremony.</p>
